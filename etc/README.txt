                               Version 0.1 alpha

AUTHOR

Image Tiles is written by Graham Lea (grlea@dev.java.net).

USAGE

To run Image Tiles, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
Version 1.4 or above will give the best results.

To use Image Tiles, simply drag and drop an image file onto 'image-tiles.bat'.
It will probably only work with JPG, PNG & GIF images.

If you want to use it from a command line, try:

   java -jar image-tiles.jar <image>

STATUS

This is a very rushed alpha version.
It works, but many things will change.
The goal is to have a screen saver that uses image tiles very soon.
There'll also eventually be a GUI to let you play around with the settings.
The source will soon be published on http://java.net/
