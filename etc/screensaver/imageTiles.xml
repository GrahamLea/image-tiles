Image Tiles

http://image-tiles.dev.java.net/

Image Tiles displays animated mosaics of images.
The screensaver contains a range of options that allow many different effects to be achieved.
A description of the meaning and effect of each option follows.

Image Directory:
Use this field to point Image Tiles at a directory/folder containing images to be displayed.

Search Subdirectories:
Enabling this option causes Image Tiles to search all subdirectories of the specified
directory/folder for images to display. Otherwise only images directly under the directory will be
displayed.

Random Image Order:
When enabled, Image Tiles will display the images it finds in a random order. Otherwise, they will
be displayed in the order they are supplied by the operating system (which, normally, is
alphabetical).

Start at Random Image:
When the 'Random Image Order' option is OFF, enabling this option will cause Image Tiles to start
displaying images from a random position in the list of images and then continue in order from that
image onward. If this option is not on, Image Tiles will always start at the same image.

Tile Size:
The size of each tile, in pixels, is determined by this setting. Variations in tile size will
greatly change the resulting effect: very small tiles will give an effect like small lights changing
colours; small tiles will give an effect like the departures board at an airport; larger tiles will
appear like pieces of a puzzle being moved into place while very large tiles will seem like large,
painted rocks sliding across the screen.
Note that the tile size and tile speed should be adjusted inversely: when raising one, raise the
other as well. Large tiles moving very quick will almost not be seen, while lots of small tiles
moving slowly will be very boring.

Gap Size:
Specifies the size of the gap between each row and column of tiles.

Animated Tiles:
Specifies the number of tiles that are animated at any one time.

Slide Speed:
Determines how fast each tile slides across the screen, specified in pixels per second.

Transition Interval:
Allows you to specify how long each image will remain on the screen after all the tiles for the
image have 'arrived' and before the tiles for the next image start appearing.

Clear Images:
After each image has fully appeared, the tiles for that image can either be cleared, leaving a blank
space for the next image to appear over, or they can be left in place, creating a 'stacking' effect
as the tiles from the next picture replace the last ones.

Target Frame Rate:
Specifies how frequently the screen will be redrawn. A higher number will result in much smoother
movement, but will also use much more processor power.

Scale Threshold:
Images that are smaller than the screen size can be scaled up. Scaling can be turned off, limited to
2X zoom or unlimited (i.e. always scale to the screen size).

Tile Choice:
The order in which tiles are chosen to be animated onto the screen can be either random (tiles start
appearing at random locations all over the screen) or sequential (tiles at the top of the screen
start appearing first).

Decorations:
Tiles can be given certain decorations to make them look more like real tiles.
'Bevel' gives tiles a 3D look by making their edges look 3D.
'Rounded Corners' rounds the corners of each tile.
'Glare' makes each tile look as if a small amount of light is reflecting off of it.
