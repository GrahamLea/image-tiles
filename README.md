# Image Tiles

Image Tiles is an image-mosaic screensaver that I wrote in 2004/2005 when [SUN thought Java would take over the desktop](http://www.javadesktop.org/articles/jdic/index.html).
However, being a model programmer, I abstracted out the code that was the core of the screen saver's mosaic animation so that it could be used in contexts outside the screensaver, e.g. in a "loading" screen.

The ability to make the graphics in Image Tiles work efficiently without melting CPUs was largely thanks to [some great articles on BufferedImages written by Chet Hasse](https://weblogs.java.net/blog/chet/archive/2003/08/bufferedimage_a.html).

There's a bit more documentation about Image Tiles at http://grahamlea.github.io/image-tiles/
