<p>The API is flexible (lots of options) and can be extended by creating custom renderers and transitions.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Image Tiles is now in a beta version, having received an amount of refactoring and a medium level
of testing. There are still some interactions that could be better abstracted, but major work on the
internals will not continue unless specific requests are made by users.</p>

<p>There are, on the other hand, an application or two still intended to be built on top of the API,
and these will result new releases as they are completed. See the CURRENT GOALS section for a list
of planned features.</p>
