<h3>Screenshots &amp; Demos</h3>
<p>This page contains screenshots and demonstrations of Image Tiles.<br>
All the demo applications on this page are included in the Image Tiles <a href="downloads.html#full">Full Release</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't like the look these demos or screenshots, keep in mind that Image Tiles is very flexible. From the size of the tiles, to their appearance, the speed at which they move and the way in which they move on and off the screen - pretty much everything in Image Tiles can be configured or extended.</p>

<p>In the future we're very keen to see new Transitions, which are the way images are moved on and off screen; all the demos below use the Slide Transition. If you have a good idea for a Transition, please <a href="mailto:grlea@dev.java.net">send it to us</a>, or, better yet, implement it yourself and send us the code!</p>


<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>The demos on this page are executed using Java WebStart.<br>
Java WebStart is installed when you install a Java Runtime.<br>
If you don't have a Java Runtime installed, download one from <a href="http://java.com/" target="_blank">java.com</a> now!</p>

</a></p>

<p>Simplest Demo also shows how easy it can be to use Image Tiles within your application. The only line of Image-Tiles code in the SimplestDemo application is:<br clear="right"><pre>
   AnimatedTileCanvas tileCanvas = new AnimatedTileCanvas(new Pipeline(image), true);
</pre></p>
