   <title>Image Tiles: Real-Time Animated Image Mosaics</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>Image Tiles is an API for producing real-time animated mosaics of images.</p>

<p>The API is flexible (lots of options) and can be extended by creating custom tile renderers and animators.</p>

<h4>Screenshot</h4>
<p><a href="imageTilesSample.jpg"><img src="imageTilesSample-small.jpg" align="right"></a>
A sample of Image Tiles running can be seen by clicking on the image at the right., although you obviously can't see the animation in a still.<br>
If you don't like what you see, keep in mind that the size, spacing and appearance of the tiles is all configurable.</p>

<h3>Sub-Projects</h3>
<p>Planned sub-projects are a screensaver and a slide show.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>The main image rendering components of Image Tiles are fully functional, though the project as a whole is still in an alpha stage.</p>

<p>Work is progressing on creating higher-level components that will allow for easy inclusion of Image Tiles into applications, as well implementing a multi-threaded model to improve rendering performance (not that it's bad at the moment).</p>

<p>There is currently one developer working on the framework and another working on more sophisticated renderers and animators.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>While we prefer not to hand out committer status until the API becomes a bit more settled and complete, we'd be very happy to receive and integrate contributions of custom renderers and animators.</p>

<h4>Required Knowledge</h4>
<p>Some knowledge of Java 2D is definitely required for working on the project, although not too much as I knew almost nothing about it before I started. :)</p>
