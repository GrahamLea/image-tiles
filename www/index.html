Image Tiles is an API for producing real-time animated mosaics of images.</p>

<p>The API is flexible (lots of options) and can be extended by creating custom renderers and transitions.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Though considerable work has been completed since Image Tiles was first released publicly, it is
still an alpha version. This is chiefly due to the fact that there are certain interactions within
the framework that are undesirable and are likely to change in the near future.</p>

<p>That being said, the changes that need to be made are mostly minor and all internal.
This means that development using the components in the swing package is unlikely to change.
Extensions to the framework may require a few semantic changes (method signatures and the like),
however the structure and division of responsibilities is unlikely to change.</p>

<p>A generic build process is now in place.</p>

<p>Many of the "higher-level components" previously promised are now available - these are AWT and Swing components that allow for easy inclusion of Image Tiles into applications.</p>
